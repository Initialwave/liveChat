Live Chat

This application is a multiple room live chat application that can be used for most platforms. It can send and receive messages directly to another user or users. 

I used socket.io and React. I chose these two to improve my knowledge base of the two technologies and to improve my skillset primarily. alternatively, I was trying to accomplish a project that could be designed and launched from a singluar repository, as i've not done that before. 

some of the challenges I face with this project were understanding how things were being autogenerated, properly connecting the backend to the frontend, and overall launching of the project to live. some of the features I'd implement in the future would be the ability to send gifs, emotes,
and small clip videos, along with the tools for IRC creators.

TO RUN THE PROJECT:
download the file, and open in VSCode. open a terminal and type npm start. with the current sequential setup, it should launch both the frontend and the backend simultaneously.
